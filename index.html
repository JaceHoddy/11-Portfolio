                <h2>Jace Hoddy</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Mountain View High School, where I was passionate about sports and played soccer,
                    baseball, wrestling, and football—staying active and learning teamwork were big parts of my high
                    school experience. After graduation, I started my college journey at Utah Tech University, where I
                    spent a semester exploring my interests before transferring to Utah Valley University to pursue a
                    degree in UX/UI Design. I've always been drawn to creativity and problem-solving, and UX design
                    feels like the perfect blend of both.

                    Currently, I work at Bucked Up as part of the inventory team, where I manage stock requests and help
                    keep operations running smoothly. Outside of work and school, you'll usually find me snowboarding in
                    the winter or golfing whenever I get the chance—I love anything that gets me outside and moving.

                    I'm excited about the future, growing in my career, and continuing to learn new things along the
                    way!</p>

                    <p>What's up? I'm Jace Hoddy a UX designer who accidentally found my passion through a career test
                        (thanks, fate!). When I'm not crafting pixel-perfect interfaces, you'll catch me smashing
                        dingers on
                        the golf course, sending backflips off mountain kickers, or dominating multiplayer lobbies with
                        ruthless headshots. Equal parts creative and competitive, I bring that same energy to designing
                        intuitive experiences that look as good as they function. Let's build something unforgettable!

                        <p>I picked up golf last year (2024), and it's quickly become the best thing ever. Nothing beats
                            ripping bombs with the boys or laughing when my friends shank one into oncoming traffic. My
                            proudest moment so far? Shooting a 79 just 7 over par and yes, I'll brag about that forever.

                        <p>I started gaming at a very young age, beginning with a LeapFrog before moving on to a Super
                            Nintendo. From there, I upgraded to the original Xbox, then the Xbox 360, and now I play on
                            a
                            custom-built PC. My favorite part about gaming? Being able to hang out with my friends when
                            it's
                            too inconvenient to meet up in real life.</p>

                        <p>I first started snowboarding when I was 7, using a cheap board to hit homemade jumps at a
                            local
                            hill. Later, I graduated to Sundance Resort—where I took to it like a natural, nailing my
                            first
                            run down the mountain without falling (and leaving my older sibling in the dust).
                            Eventually, I
                            moved to the terrain park, mastering box grinds, rail slides, 360s off 20-foot kickers, and
                            ground tricks like butters.</p>
